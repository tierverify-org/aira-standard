# AIRA™ — AI‑Reviewed, Author‑Generated  
### A Transparency Standard for Human‑Generated Content

AIRA™ is an open transparency standard for documenting when AI tools were used to review, refine, or support a human author’s work — without replacing the human’s ideas, intent, or authorship.

This repository contains the official AIRA Standard, Framework, Governance Charter, Adoption Guide, and supporting documentation maintained by tierverify-org.

---

## Purpose

AIRA exists to make AI involvement transparent in a way that:
- preserves human authorship  
- clarifies the role of AI review  
- supports ethical and responsible content creation  
- enables verifiable disclosure  
- builds trust between authors and audiences  

AIRA is not an AI‑generation standard.  
It is a **human authorship transparency standard**.
