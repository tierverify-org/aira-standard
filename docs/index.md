## Overview

AIRA™ - AI‑Reviewed, Author‑Generated - is a lightweight transparency standard for human‑generated work that includes non‑material AI assistance.  
It is designed for real‑world environments where creators, reviewers, and organizations need a simple, consistent way to disclose AI involvement without adding friction or bureaucracy.

AIRA focuses on a narrow but critical slice of the transparency landscape:

- Human‑generated content  
- With AI assistance that does not materially alter authorship  
- Where disclosure improves clarity, trust, and accountability  

The standard defines a clear, repeatable method for documenting this assistance across documents, workflows, and organizational processes.  
It is intentionally minimal, easy to adopt, and compatible with existing governance frameworks.

AIRA is not a certification, audit, or compliance regime.  
It is a practical disclosure layer - a way to communicate *how* AI contributed without overstating or obscuring the human role.

The goal is simple:  
**Make transparency effortless, consistent, and trustworthy.**
